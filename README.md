## About Project

Visiri is an application that allows users to upload cell microscopy images and create datasets that will allow deep learning
models to automatically count cells.

Using a mobile device camera linked to the eyepiece of a microscope, a neural network must be trained with user's laboratory-specific imaging equipment and cells in order for automated counting to work.

This project is actively being developed in stages with the first being the frontend and data storage architectures for generating these calibration datasets.

In this current build, users can upload images of their cells and label the cells in a mobile-friendly browser-based interface. Intuitive manipulation of image zoom and panning is important to workflow and Visiri supports touch events such as pinch zooming and dragging as well as desktop mouse/wheel events.

The next build will establish the convolutional neural network models and deploying GPU-based architecture for training/prediction and task scheduling.
